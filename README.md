- Use textbox to display the last temperature recorded and a diagnosis
- Use textboxes to display the 14 day average based on data stored in the listbox
- Include buttons for Record Reading and Clear Readings

## For Full Credit:
- Program must be well documented and controls well named according to standards.

- Readings must be numeric and accept decimal places
- Readings must be between 0 and 115 
- if statement with LOGICAL OPERATOR must be used.
- Appropriate and distinct error messages should be displayed.
- Temperatures must be formatted with 2 decimal places
- You must use a SELECT CASE  to determine the diagnosis based on ranges for the last reading and average reading.
-- less than 95 is Hypothermia
-- 95 to 99 is Normal
-- 99 and greater or equal to 103 is Fever
-- greater than 103 is Seek Attention
- A FOR NEXT loop must be used to iterate the readings list box and accumulate the total readings
- The program must NOT  allow more than 14 readings.
- It should disable the record and textbox when that count has been hit.
- You must use a CONSTANT    for the max number of readings.
- Use the same set of data for your program and the Runtime.  They must match.
- Record and Clear buttons must be functional
